# Copilot Instructions

## General Guidelines
- Provide concise, expert answers in French (fr-FR).
- Use imperative mood for instructions (e.g., "Use X" instead of "You should use X").

## Project-Specific Rules
- Focus on WinUI 3 / WinRT projects using CommunityToolkit MVVM and ObservableProperty source generator.
- Ensure that all code examples and suggestions are relevant to Visual Studio 2026.
- Utilize the [ObservableProperty] source generator from CommunityToolkit MVVM and employ partial properties compatible with CsWinRT for WinRT/WinUI scenarios.
